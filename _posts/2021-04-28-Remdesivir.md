#### Does Remdesivir kill Coronavirus?
No, Remdesivir does NOT kill the coronavirus but Remdesivir does block Coronavirus.
Remdesivir doesn't prevent people from being infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it gives them time to fight it.

Whereas a vaccine is designed prompt your immune system to recognize the spike protein that allows Coronavirus to invade cells — and protect people from infection — antivirals such as remdesivir aim to disrupt the virus' ability to replicate, to slow its spread and give your body extra time to develop immunity.

#### What is the price of Remdesivir in India?

With a significant rise in daily coronavirus cases in India, the manufacturers of Remdesivir have reduced the price of the anti-viral drug to Rs 899, which was earlier priced at Rs 2,800. The price of the drug varies from company to company but it is now available under Rs 3,500.
