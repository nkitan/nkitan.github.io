<br>
This website contains various resources, guides and news against the COVID-19 virus and provides an easy way to get information and help without having to scrap the internet.

NOTICE: Please do not pay before availing services. Many unheartly people have started a scam which involves duping people off their money by asking for advance payment. Decline any such demands as there are various legitimate sources.
